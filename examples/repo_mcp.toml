# Stack-specific notes:
# - Python repos often also exclude: "**/.hypothesis/**", "**/.ipynb_checkpoints/**"
# - Node repos often also exclude: "**/.turbo/**", "**/.parcel-cache/**"
# - Rust repos often also exclude: "**/.cargo/**"
# - Java/Gradle repos often also exclude: "**/.gradle/**", "**/.idea/**"
# - .NET repos often also exclude: "**/TestResults/**", "**/*.user", "**/*.suo"
#
# If your repository intentionally stores source-of-truth files in one of these paths,
# remove that glob from exclude_globs.
#
# Tuning order:
# 1) Keep deterministic noise excludes.
# 2) Adjust [limits] based on latency vs recall.
# 3) Expand include_extensions or relax excludes only for real source-of-truth paths.
